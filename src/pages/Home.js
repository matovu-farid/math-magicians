      Even though everyone learns mathematics at school, it is difficult
      to define exactly what mathematics is. Clearly numbers, shapes and
      equations form part of it, but only a small part compared to the
      vast space of mathematical concepts and ideas. The best way to
      understand what mathematics is and what mathematicians work
      on – is to do mathematics.

      One idea that appears everywhere in mathematics is abstraction.
      Instead of thinking about particular numbers, shapes, equations
      or any other objects, mathematicians tend to think about their

      underlying structures and patterns. This means that the results,
      called Theorems, are more general and provide deeper insight.
      Another fundamental idea in mathematics is Proof. Mathematicians
      can’t just say that an idea is true, or test it in a few cases.
      They need a rigorous and watertight argument to deduce that it
      is always true. Maybe this makes mathematics more difficult than
      other sciences, but it also means that mathematicians can obtain
      absolute and definitive knowledge – which is impossible in any
      other discipline.

      Despite being so abstract and theoretical, mathematics has countless
      applications in every possible aspect of life. Without mathematics our
      civilisation would be little more advanced than the ancient Egyptians:
      we wouldn’t have governments funded by a tax system, no phones,
      no television, no computers, no internet and no satellite navigation.
      The cultural value and the monetary economic value of mathematics
      are too large to measure.
